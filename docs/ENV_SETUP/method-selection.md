# Which Method Should I Use?

## For Cursor AI Integration:
→ **Method 1** (mcp.json) - Required

## For CLI Development/Testing:
→ **Method 2** (.env file) - Recommended
→ **Method 3** (export) - Quick testing

## For Both:
You can use **both** methods simultaneously:
- Use `mcp.json` for Cursor
- Use `.env` file for CLI testing
