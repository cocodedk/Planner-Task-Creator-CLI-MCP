# Tips & Best Practices

## 1. Set Your Defaults
Makes creating tasks easier:
```
Set FITS as my default plan and "To do" as my default bucket
```

Now you can create tasks without specifying plan/bucket each time:
```
Create a task called "Quick task"
```

## 2. Use Descriptive Task Names
```
✅ Good: "Review authentication PR #123"
❌ Bad: "Review"
```

## 3. Add Due Dates
```
Create a task due next Friday
Create a task due 2025-12-31
```

## 4. Use Labels for Priority/Categories
```
Create a task with Label1 (high priority)
Add a task with Label3 (bug category)
```
