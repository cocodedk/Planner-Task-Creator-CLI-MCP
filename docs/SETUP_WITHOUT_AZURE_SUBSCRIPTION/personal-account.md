# Personal Microsoft Account (Limited)

If you have a personal Microsoft account with Microsoft 365 subscription:

## Limitations

- Personal Microsoft accounts have limited Azure AD capabilities
- You may not be able to register apps
- **Recommendation:** Use [Developer Program](developer-program.md) instead

## What You Can Try

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your personal Microsoft account
3. If you see "No subscriptions found" - that's okay!
4. Look for **Azure Active Directory** in the left menu
5. If it's not available, use [Developer Program](developer-program.md)

## Alternative

The [Developer Program](developer-program.md) provides the same functionality for free and is much easier to set up.
