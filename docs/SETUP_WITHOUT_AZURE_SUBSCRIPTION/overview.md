# Overview

**Good news!** You don't need an Azure subscription to use this tool. You only need:

1. A Microsoft 365 account (work, school, or personal with Microsoft 365)
2. Access to Microsoft Planner
3. Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID) - available for free

## Why No Azure Subscription?

**Azure AD ≠ Azure Subscription**

- **Azure Subscription**: Paid cloud services (VMs, databases, etc.)
- **Azure AD**: Identity management (free with Microsoft 365)

This tool only needs Azure AD, not an Azure subscription!
