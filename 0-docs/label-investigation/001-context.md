- Review test coverage
- Identify limitations
- Propose potential enhancements

### Out of Scope
- Implementing new label features (investigation only)
- Changing existing label functionality
- Performance optimization

## Key Questions

1. How does Microsoft Planner represent labels in the Graph API?
2. What label functionality is currently implemented?
3. How well tested is the label functionality?
4. What are the current limitations?
5. What enhancements would add value?

## Success Criteria

- Complete documentation of label functionality
- Clear understanding of API schema
- Identification of enhancement opportunities
- Planning artifacts for potential future work
